        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.

        <p>
            Catch an idea üí°! This mission is actually easy. Perimeter is a sum of lengths of all sides of rectangle. And opposite sides of rectangle have the same length. That's everything you need.

        Ok, what should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You have <b class="code">length</b> and <b class="code">width</b>, add them together.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
length + width
        </pre>

        What to do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Other two sides have the same length, so to get perimeter you need to multiply previous sum by 2.

        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>You just need to wrap your code into function expression and return the result.</p>
        <p>Here is the whole solution:</p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
function rectanglePerimeter(length: number, width: number): number {

    return (length + width)*2;
}
        </pre>
